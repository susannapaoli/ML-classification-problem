# Machine Learning general project

This is a general machine learning workflow implementation for a classification problem. After some statistical and exploratory analysis, I will be implementing different estimation techniques for classification:
1. K-nearest neighbours 
2. Logistic regression 
3. Random forest 

Each model is first evaluated using standardized hyper-parameters and cross-validation. After that, we move to hyper-parameter tuning, by creating a table of parameters to be tested and using then a GridSearchCV. 

Models are implemented using simple machine learning pipelines, with scalers and models.
